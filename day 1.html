        <h1>Hello NATURE LOVERS !!</h1>

        <P>
         
          The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, 
          literally meant "birth".In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis, which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, 
          and other features of the world develop of their own accord.

          Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, 
          and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.

          It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention,
           or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, 
          for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature"
